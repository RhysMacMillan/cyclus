/// This includes the required header to add facility costs to archetypes.
/// One should only need to:
/// - '#include "toolkit/facility_cost.cycpp.h"' in the header of the
///    archetype class (as private)
/// - Add `InitEconParameters()` to `EnterNotify()` in the cc file of the
///   archetype class, and then `GetCost()` should become available.

/// How to add parameters to this file:
/// 1. Add the pragma. A default value MUST be added to ensure backwards
///    compatibility.
/// 2. Edit the unordered_map called "econ_params"
///          i. add the desired parameter to the array {"name", value}
///         ii. the value of the pair should be the variable name exactly
/// 3. Add "std::vector<int> cycpp_shape_<param_name> = {0};" to the end of the
///    file with the other ones, reaplcing <param_name> with the name you put
///    in the econ_params array (again, must match exactly).
